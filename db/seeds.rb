Most notably, Cordoba is using an integrated neck joint or “Spanish Heel” instead of a traditional dovetail joint to join the body and neck of the ukulele. This method of construction offers a lighter weight and more stable heel joint that increases resonance and is less prone to movement as the ukulele ages. Cordoba collaborated with renowned luthier Pepe Romero Jr. on the 30 series, adopting Romero’s vision of building ukuleles as if they are small guitars using traditional Spanish building methods. The result is an incredibly lightweight tenor ukulele with a deeper and wider body, featuring a Spanish heel neck joint, fan bracing, and a wider fingerboard for easy playability.' , image: 'http://images.samash.com/sa/C35/C35TCEXXX-P.fpx?cell=540,400&qlt=90&cvt=jpg' , model: '35T-CE' , msrp: 850 , orientation: 'Right-Handed' , price: 749 , series: '30 Series' , year: 2013, bridge_type: 'Rosewood' , number_of_frets: 18 , neck_type: 'Spanish Heel' , body_wood: 'AcaciaMahogany' , case_type: 'Polyfoam Case' , tuning_machines: 'Open Gears, Premium Solid Tonewoods, Hand-Rubbed Thin Polyurethane Finish, Chrome Grover Tuning Machines')

The Grand Auditorium was the first guitar shape designed from scratch by Bob Taylor. It was unveiled to commemorate the company\'s 20th Anniversary in 1994, and since then it has more than lived up to its promise. Although the Taylor GA acoustic-electric guitar has the width and depth of a dreadnought, its narrower waist gives it the appearance of a smaller instrument, adds treble "zing" across the guitar\'s tonal spectrum, sharpens the definition of individual notes, and also enables it to rest comfortably in the lap. Because Taylor removes mass from the width of the GA\'s braces, the guitar top moves faster, resulting in a snappy, bell-like tone. The Taylor GA acoustic-electric guitar is designed to be a strong fingerpicking guitar that also can handle medium strumming, and is exceptionally versatile. The cutaway feature on the Taylor guitar\'s body makes reaching the upper-register frets a snap, giving you comfortable access up and down the ebony fret board.' , image: 'http://images.samash.com/sa/T21/T214CEGXX-P.fpx?cell=540,400&qlt=90&cvt=jpg' , model: '214-CE-G' , msrp: 1328 , price: 999 , series: 'Two-Hundred' , year: 2014)
